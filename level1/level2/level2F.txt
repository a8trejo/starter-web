Amongst other dictates, the Jedi Code forbade Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters from taking on more than one Padawan at a given time;[2] and forbade Jedi from forming attachments, such as marriage,[3] and other specific, individual bonds, such as family and romantic love. Few understood that this practice of non-attachment did not mean the Jedi were strangers to compassion when, in fact, they believed that all lives were precious.[4] The code also forbade the Jedi from killing unarmed opponents[5] as well as seeking revenge.[6]
