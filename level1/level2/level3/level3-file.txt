During the Clone Wars, there were those in the Grand Army of the Republic, such as Wilhuff Tarkin, who believed that the Jedi Code prevented the Order from doing what was necessary to win the war against the Confederacy of Independent Systems.[7] Shortly before the end of the Clone Wars, the Jedi High Council, through Obi-Wan Kenobi, asked Anakin Skywalker to spy upon the activities of his friend, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, something which Skywalker felt was against the Jedi Code.[5]
