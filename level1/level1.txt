The Jedi Code was a set of rules that governed the behavior of the Jedi Order. It taught its followers to not give in to feelings of anger toward other lifeforms, which would help them resist fear and prevent them from falling to the dark side of the Force.[1]

In 34 ABY, on Ahch-To, Rey heard the soft chanting of the Jedi Code emanating from the tree library that contained the original Jedi texts. The chanting compelled her to enter the library, where she found the texts and began learning more about the history of the Jedi Order from Master Luke Skywalker.
